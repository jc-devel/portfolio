            I'm a passionate web developer with over 5 years of experience in creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. My journey in web development started with a curiosity for creating interactive experiences, and it has since grown into a fulfilling career where I continuously learn and apply new technologies.

            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and am always excited to take on new challenges.

            I'm currently looking for new opportunities to bring my skills and passion to a team that values innovation and collaboration.
